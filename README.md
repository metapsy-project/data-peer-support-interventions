The `data-peer-support` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) which is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of randomized trials on peer support interventions for individuals with mental illness. The date of the last search update is provided [here](https://github.com/metapsy-project/data-peer-support/blob/main/metadata/last_search.txt). More details about this database can be accessed in the published [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36066104/).

This dataset includes peer support interventions (PSIs) vs. control (`PSIs vs ctr`) comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for three types of recovery outcomes at post-test: clinical recovery, personal recovery, and functional recovery . 
It includes one type of effect size calculation per study, giving priority to means and standard deviations at post-test, followed by change scores, binary outcomes, and other statistics.

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/).
